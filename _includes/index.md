## [Whodat](https://github.com/bperlik/whodat){:target="_blank"} ##

* A quick, easy Ruby Gem that adds very simple users and sessions to your Rails app, removing the task of long set up of more complex user gems during development.

* I used a Rails engine and BCrypt. It's very simple to add to a Rails project and have a user to start development right away. It's an open source project, so contributions are desired and welcomed!

## [Perlik-metrics](https://github.com/bperlik/perlik-metrics){:target="_blank"} ##

* An analytic service to track events on websites.

* Users can sign-up, login, register an application to track events, view and save events tracked on the registered applications, view graphs of the event data, and logout.

### Features: ###
* A client-side JavaScript snippet that allows a user to track events on their website.

* A server-side API that captures and saves those events to a database.

* A Rails application that displays the captured event data for a user.
