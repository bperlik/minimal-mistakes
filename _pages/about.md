## Researcher turned Software Developer ##

### Summary ###
Coding has always been a hobby for me. It wasn’t until I started data analysis and setting up layouts in fundraising software that I realized how much I enjoyed it. I love researching, computers, and helping others learn, so I learned on the job and worked my way up in data analysis and prospect research in higher education fundraising. However, when I realized that I loved coding just as much as I loved research, I knew it was time to make a career change.

### The Details ###
I’ve loved brain teasers, puzzles, and computers ever since I was a kid. My father, a senior systems analyst, would bring home computers and let me play with them. I spent hours building my first program in basic, a hearing test. College courses in statistical analysis and psychological research required using computers to process the data. During one college course that required making money from a website in one semester, I built a SAS website that took orders for hosiery for women of color, and several other basic websites. Dabbling in code had always been a hobby of mine since I was young. I was lucky to have managers who put their faith in me and let me step into responsibilities like data analysis, database maintenance, and report development, which gave me many opportunities to learn and succeed.

Using databases and the complex software for fundraising raised my awareness of the need for better backend software and frontend interfaces. Simply matching a form to the input screen saved hours of time and frustration. While developing routine reports for everyday use and custom reports for special events, I learned how important clean data, accurate analysis, and the report format is for communication of information. However, I realized that I loved coding just as much as I loved research and had an opportunity to learn to code from experts.

Naturally, I researched different opportunities to learn how to code. Being in a university setting, I included college degree programs and courses, but decided that the college structure and accreditation process contribute to college computer programs to teach older languages and frameworks. I found several online and in-person bootcamps were highly recommended by those who had switched careers. I enrolled in [Bloc.io](http://bloc.io), because of its software engineering program and its apprenticeship with mentors. Bloc’s curriculum covered frontend, backend, included engineering principles, and many projects and open source contributions, which helped me understand why code works, not just what code to use. Pair programmimg with a mentor and participation in group sessions gave me a deeper understanding of coding and considerable experience in coding remotely with other. 

My research skills help me locate reliable sources for information needed in using languages, frameworks, tools, etc. My patience and experience in listening to fundraisers to provide reports and guidance helps me work with clients and team members to develop the service or product needed. My love of learning makes it fun to learn new languages, frameworks and other tool. It's very rewarding, just like fundraising in education, it's helping others reach their dreams... by contributing in creating a solution to fix a problem or bring an idea to reality.
