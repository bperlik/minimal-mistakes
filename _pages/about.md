### Always Learning ###
Coding has always been a hobby for me. It wasn’t until I started data analysis and setting up layouts in fundraising software that I realized how much I enjoyed it. I love researching, computers, and helping others learn, so I learned on the job and worked my way up data analysis and prospect research in higher education fundraising. However, when I realized that I loved coding just as much as I loved research, I knew it was time to make a career change.

I’ve loved computers ever since I was a kid. My father, a senior systems analyst, would bring home computers and I spent hours building my first program in basic, a hearing test. Later in a college course, I built a SAS website that took orders for hosiery for women of color, and several other basic websites. Dabbling in code had always been a hobby of mine since I was young, I was lucky to have managers who put their faith in me and let me step into roles like data analysis, database maintenance, and report developer, which gave me many opportunities to learn and succeed.

Using databases and the complex software for fundraising raised my awareness of the need for better backend software and frontend interfaces. Simply matching a form to the input screen saved hours of time and frustration. While developing routine reports for everyday use and custom reports for special events, I learned how important clean data, the accurate analysis, and the report format is for communcation of information. However, I realized that I loved coding just as much as I loved research and I knew it was right time to make a career change.

I enrolled in Bloc apprenticeship program to obtain a much deeper understanding and an organized curriculum. Bloc’s curriculum covered frontend and backend, and included engineering principles, which helped me understand how everything connects. My research skills help me locate reliable sources for information needed in using languages, frameworks, tools, etc. Experience in listening to fundraisers to provide reports and guidance helps me work with clients and teammembers to develop the service or product needed.
